            <p>In Giulianova, a visit to the beach is a must. This stretch of coastline is equally popular with tourists and locals, as it offers a wide range of activities, restaurants and beautiful views. Although it is livelier during the summer, the beach area is just as charming and full of life in the winter, when it is populated with people taking long walks, running, cycling, or picnicking on the beach. This is due to the area's temperate climate that makes the winters not too harsh.</p>
