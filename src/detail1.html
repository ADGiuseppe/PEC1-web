            <img src="../images/Duomo_Giulianova.jpg" alt="San Flaviano Cathedral">
            <p>The Church of St. Flavianus in Giulianova, erected between 1472 and 1500, is dedicated to the Holy Patriarch of Constantinople, whose relics arrived in the city in 1004, possibly following a shipwreck. Initially named for St. Mary, it was later dedicated to St. Flavian after the transfer of his relics in 1478. The church, with an octagonal plan and a hemispherical dome, is a rare example of Renaissance architecture in Abruzzo.</p>
            <p>The structure's imposing height makes it a visible landmark for the surrounding area. Originally decorated with blue glazed tiles, the church houses a crypt with a ceiling considered an engineering masterpiece, where the saint's relics were kept.</p>
            <p>Today, the church holds contemporary works of art, including sculptures by Venanzo Crocetti and Francesco Coccia. In addition, an exterior plaque commemorates the fallen of World War I, topped by a bronze eagle by Ulderico Ulizio.</p>
