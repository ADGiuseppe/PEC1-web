            <p> Giulianova, in the province of Teramo, has a past that is lost in ancient times: founded as a Roman colony, today it is divided into Giulianova Alta, the historic centre built in the 15th century on top of the hill, and Giulianova Lido, by the sea, which has developed instead since the 20th century, thanks above all to the presence of the fishing port. The fishing tradition here is very strong and the catch is exported to various regions. The port remains the heart of activity. Symbolic is also its location, right in the centre: here every day the spectacle of arrivals and departures, of fish being unloaded to be sold or transported, of seagulls circling hoping to get food. And over it all, the tales of the sea, always the same and always different.</p>
